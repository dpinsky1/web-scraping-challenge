# web-scraping-challenge

Many thanks to Saad Khan for the help with part 2 of this.

# Part 1

Part one consists of a webscrape of article names and summaries, and storing them in a dictionary. 

# Part 2

Part two takes data from a webscrape and converts it to a pandas DataFrame. Some general analysis is done, including estimation of martian years based on cyclical fluctuations of minimum temperatures.
I would have loved to have used pd.read_html, but that's okay.
